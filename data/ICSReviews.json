    "description": "&quot;Fun&quot; professor, but lectures are confusing. Barely any notes on his slides that he posts online (if you don't go to lecture, you won't understand the notes he writes on the slides). Only good thing is that he is flexible with deadlines (asks for students' opinions), often moves back deadlines. Takes a thousand years to grade your assignments/exams",
